## üìù Project description

European clinical guidelines recommend that patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including ischaemic heart disease (IHD), stroke and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), are prescribed lipid lowering treatment (LLT) and treated to target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. This study aimed to document trends in ASCVD including treatment, monitoring, and achievement of target LDL-C.
